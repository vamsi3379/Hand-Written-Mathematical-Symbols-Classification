# About the Project

The project's objective is to build a machine-learning model that can correctly recognize a collection of mathematical symbols.We are implementing our project approach using a large data set with various symbols to be categorized by the code. The dataset is created by the team and includes 10 symbol patterns to match and classify. Each team member contributed to about 10 images of varied forms of each symbol, I.e., 100 symbols by single team member. We have used about 400 images to be classified by the algorithm. Each image in the data set can be characterized into any one of the symbols given below. Each symbol has three characteristics parameters. These parameters are Math Symbol, Label and Integer Encoding. Math symbol is the symbol pattern that needs to be matched by the algorithm with the data to classify. Label is the character equivalent of each symbol and Integer Encoding is an integer digit assigned of each symbol and the values range from 0 to 9.

In this project, we have used Resnet50 to classify different handwritten symbols and achieved a 90.55% over 9032 test samples. Performance of the classification can be shown using the confusion matrix between the predicted and the true values over the test can be seen in the below figure
